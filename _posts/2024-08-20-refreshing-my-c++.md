### Aims:

The primary aims of this are:
1. Refresh the basic concepts of C++
2. Learn from a longer, deeper dive into C++
3. Build out a couple of sample applications in C++

### Part One: Refreshing the Basics [(Mosh Hamedani- C++ for Beginners Tutorial in 1 hour)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzaPdXTrSb8&t=442s)
I decided to bring myself a little more up-to-date with this introductory tutorial from Mosh to get set up with a modern C++ development platform before going into a much deeper dive.

#### Notes:
1. I am going to start by provisioning a Windows 11 Hyper-V Virtual Machine for this developer environment.
2. Installation of Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition - I chose this over VS Code as I expect that when I return to professional development Visual Studio will be the preferred option.
3. Build a quick test app - HelloWorld, Done, Success so let's move on.

### Part Two: A Deeper Dive - C++ in One Hour a Day (Sams Teach Yourself)
I had started reading this book about a year ago, and at the time thought that maybe I should look to go through this book in way more detail to get the maximum benefit from its content.

#### Learnings:
1. A Brief History of C++: 
- Initially developed by Bjarne Stroustroup back in 1979, originally to be a successor to C.
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 supports C++11, C++14 and C++17.
- C++ is considered an intermediate-level programming language as it allows for both high-level programming of applications as well as low-level programming of libraries that work close to the hardware.
- Applications, operating systems, web services, databases and enterprise software are programmed in C++.
- Software engineers often use C++ as the language of choice for research by physicists and mathematicians - although I believe that languages such as Python are probably in greater use in these areas <- this is my belief.

2. Programming First C++ Application (HelloWorld):


### Part Three: Sample C++ Applications
The goal of this part is to actually build out a few sample C++ applications to prectice what I am learning on the C++ journey.

1. C++ Application: Tic-Tac-Toe
2. C++ Application: Basic Inventory Management System 
3. C++ Application: Personal Expense Tracker

### Optimising VS Code setup with Profiles:

During my latest C++ development learning I came to realise that my setup of VS Code was less than optimal.
Over the last year or so I have been learning and using many different languages, frameworks, etc and this has led to my VS Code enviroment being overloaded with extensions and settings that are project specific.
This could not be allowed to continue, so I took it upon myself to look into what can be done to help me with this daunting task.

At the beginning of the day i was notified on my Ubuntu development laptop that there was an updated version of VS Code. So I decided to update this.
When I restarted VS Code I was presented with a list of enhancements to the latest version of VS Code, and one of these caught my eyes..

VS Code Profile... Maybe I should look into these and look to implement these into my VS Code enviroment.

So this is my task for today. Although not directly on my list of learnings, I decided this could only help to optimise my developer process.

#### Outline:
1. I exported my current settings, extensions from the default profile.
2. Saved this to my [github](https://github.com/designcodemastery/vscode-profiles).
3. Deleted all the installed extensions.
4. Start creating a series of specific VS Code Profiles....

#### So, What did I learn?

1. VS Code's profiles allow me to customise settings, extensions, keybindings, and other configurations for specific types of projects or workflows.

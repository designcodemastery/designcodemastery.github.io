### Aims:

The primary aim of the project is to put into practice some of the C++ I am relearning along with that which I can recall from the dark, distant past, and maybe a little AI guidance.

#### Outline:
1. Simple console app
2. Against the computer
3. Random function determines who has first move
4. Optional/stretch goal, allow the user to challenge the computer to a "best of" tournament

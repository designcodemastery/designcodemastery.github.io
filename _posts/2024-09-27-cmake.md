### Learning about CMake while doing my C++ Developments

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator that helps manage and automate the build process for software projects. Its primary purpose is to generate build files for different platforms and environments, allowing developers to compile code in a consistent way. CMake supports multiple compilers and operating systems and can generate native build environments like Makefiles, Ninja, or Visual Studio projects.

Facilities provided by CMake include:

- Platform Independence: Simplifies creating build scripts that work across different platforms.
- Modularity: Allows separation of project components into reusable modules.
- Custom Build Configuration: Offers flexible options for debugging, optimizing, and testing builds.
- Dependency Management: Helps manage project dependencies, especially for large and complex projects.
- Integration: Supports various compilers and tools, including IDEs, unit testing frameworks, and version control systems.

It's widely used for C/C++ projects but is adaptable for many programming languages.
